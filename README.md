# RABBDA project

RABBDA (Reduce Access Barriers to Big Data Analytics) is created by the [Centre of Parallel Computing](https://www.westminster.ac.uk/research/groups-and-centres/centre-for-parallel-computing) - University of Westminster.

Project objective is to provide students and practitioners access to Big Data technologies and learning material.

For that purpose Centre of Parallel Computing currently develops a Big Data environment based on the Hadoop ecosystem that can be accessed students and researchers.

Additionally, Centre of Parallel Computing provides learning material, to assist the learning process. These material includes Hadoop services tutorials and demo applications.

The services being used and learning material are open-source so that everyone can have access to and learn how to formulate there own Big Data applications.

RABBDA is the first attempt to merge a Science Gateway with a KREL (knowledge repository and learning), called [SMARTEST](https://smartest-repo.herokuapp.com/)
to facilitate the comprehension of the various aspects of the portal.
